- <kbd>decorator `require_condition`</kbd>

For usage in a class, let's you set a condition in which a method is allowed to be called

- <kbd>decorator `once`</kbd>

Functions decorated with `once` either always return the result of the 1st call or raise an error if called a 2nd time

- <kbd>decorator `limit`</kbd>

Functions decorated with `limit` are allowed to be called on set amount of times
